# SilverStripe Multisites

## Overview

Allows for multiple websites to be managed through a single site tree. 

This is an alternative module to the Subsites module; it avoids any session
tracking of the 'current' website, and doesn't perform any query modification 
at runtime to change the 'site' context of queries you execute

## Installation

* Add the module and the multivaluefield module
* Run dev/build
* Run dev/tasks/MultisitesInitTask


## Known issues

* See github
